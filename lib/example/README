LICENSE:
This program is licensed under a BSD-style license, with additional restrictions
on naming. See the LICENSE.txt file in the top-level pmcomm-src directory for details.

OVERVIEW:
This is a simple example program which should demonstrate how to use libpmcomm to read
display data, program data, and logged data from the PentaMetric.

Writing program data is not shown, but is similar to reading.


REQUIREMENTS:
First, make sure libpmcomm is compiled (in the parent directory)

This demo is known to work on Mac OS 10.8, Ubuntu 12.04, and Windows 8 using the MinGW compiler,
and probably works on other similar platforms.


COMPILING:
First, open up main.cpp and uncomment and adjust the appropriate calls at the top of main()
to open either a serial port or TCP/IP connection to to the PentaMetric.

Also, uncomment the demo you want to run.

Run "make" in this directory.  This should generate an executable called example (or example.exe
on Windows).

On Windows, it is necessary to copy libpmcomm.dll from the libpmcomm directory into the
examples directory.  It should just work on other platforms, unless the executable is moved.
Then, just run this executable and it should print out some live data from the PentaMetric.
